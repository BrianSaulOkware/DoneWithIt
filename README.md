# DoneWithIt
This YouTube video tutorial covers the fundamentals of setting up a React Native project, from downloading and installing the required applications like Node.js and Visual Studio Code to using the Expo CLI to start a new project from scratch. The advantages of using the Expo app for Android development, which enables program updates to be communicated straight to the app without requiring a connection to a computer, are also discussed. The video's creator walks viewers through the process of setting up a React Native project step-by-step, from downloading the required applications like Node.js and Visual Studio Code to installing the Expo CLI via a command prompt or terminal and starting a new project with a blank template using the Expo init command. Additionally, it introduces the "Done With It" app which will be built throughout the course, a real-world marketplace app for users to sell things they no longer need.

The video also teaches how to debug and run a React Native app on iOS and Android emulators and physical devices, as well as how to use various debugging tools such as Chrome Developer Tools, Visual Studio Code, and the Expo client. Furthermore, the video explains how to publish the app to Expo for testing and how to add local and network images to the app using touchable components. Additionally, the tutorial covers the core components and APIs in React Native, such as view, text, image, button, touchable, alert, and more, and introduces the safe area view, a special type of view in React Native that ensures that content does not get hidden behind the notch or other areas of the screen. Finally, the instructor promotes their Ultimate React Native course, which covers basics and advanced topics and includes source code, exercises, step-by-step solutions, and a certificate of completion.
